```{r}
#Clearing up the environment and setting a seed for easy replication of results:
rm(list=ls())
set.seed('19200062')

#Loading required libraries:
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
library(shiny)
library(ggiraph)
library(gganimate)
library(reshape2)

```

**1. Import the dataset exo_data.csv as a tibble. Columns 1, 16, 17, 18, 25 should be characters. Columns 2, 14 should be factors. Column 15 should be integers. The remaining columns should be doubles.**

```{r}
#Importing the evo_data as a tibble and storing in a variable exodat:
exodat<-read_csv("exo_data.csv")
class(exodat)
is_tibble(exodat)

str(exodat)

#Identifying the column names to convert to respective datatypes:
colnames(exodat[,c(1,16,17,18,25)])
exodat$id %<>% as.character
exodat$recency %<>% as.character
exodat$r_asc %<>% as.character
exodat$decl %<>% as.character
exodat$lists %<>% as.character

colnames(exodat[,c(2,14)])
exodat$flag %<>% as.factor
exodat$meth %<>% as.factor

colnames(exodat[,15])
exodat$year %<>% as.integer

```

**2. Exclude the exoplanets with an unknown method of discovery.**

```{r}
#drop_na() is a function in the dplyr package used to remove missing values.

#Using drop_na() to drop rows containing missing values (unknown) of the method variable:
exodat<-exodat %>% drop_na(meth)

#We can observe that 63 observations have been dropped, now we have 3596 observations.
```

**3. Create a graphic which illustrates the relationship between the log-distances from the Sun and the methods of discovery.**

```{r}
p <- ggplot(exodat, aes(x = log(dist), fill = meth, color = meth))
p <- p + geom_histogram(position = "identity")
p <- p + labs(title = "Plot of log-distance from Sun", x = "Log-distance from Sun (parsec)", y = "Frequency")
p
```

**4. Create scatterplots of the log-mass versus log-distances, separating by methods of discovery. Hovering with the cursor highlights the point and displays its name, and, if you click, the exoplanetâ€™s page on the Open Exoplanet Catalogue will be opened.**

```{r}
exodat$onclick <- sprintf("window.open(\"%s%s\")",
                          "http://www.openexoplanetcatalogue.com/planet/",
                          exodat$id)

scatter_plot = ggplot(exodat,
                      aes(x = log(mass),
                          y = log(dist),
                          color = meth)) +
                      labs(title = "Log-mass vs. Log-distances",
                           x = "Log-mass",
                           y = "Log-distances") +
                      geom_point_interactive(aes(data_id = id,
                                                 tooltip = id,
                                                 onclick = onclick)) +
                      scale_color_discrete(name = "Method of discovery")

ggiraph(code = print(scatter_plot))
```

**5. Rename the radius into jupiter_radius, and create a new column called earth_radius which is 11.2 times the Jupiter radius.**

```{r}
exodat <- exodat %>% rename(jupiter_radius = radius) # rename() function from tidyverse with pipe.

exodat <- exodat %>% mutate(earth_radius = (jupiter_radius*11.2))
```

**6. Focus only on the rows where log-earth radius and log-period have no missing values, and perform kmeans with four clusters on these two columns.**

```{r}
# Focus only on the rows where radius of Earth and period have no missing values
exodat2 <- exodat %>% drop_na(earth_radius, period)  # 2732 obs

#log-radius of Earth and log-period
exodat2 <- exodat2 %>%
            mutate(LogEarthRadius = log(earth_radius),
                   LogPeriod = log(period))

# data to perform Kmeans
model.kmeans <- exodat2 %>% 
                  select(LogEarthRadius, LogPeriod)

# perform k-means
fitk  <- kmeans(model.kmeans, 4)

table(fitk$cluster)
```

**7. Add the clustering labels to the dataset through a new factor column called type, with levels rocky, hot_jupiters, cold_gas_giants, others; similarly to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet#/media/File:ExoplanetPopulations-20170616.png and produce the scatterplot highlighting these clusters.**

```{r}
fitk$cluster <- as.factor(fitk$cluster)

ggplot(model.kmeans, aes(LogPeriod, LogEarthRadius, color = fitk$cluster)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title="Clustering solutions of Exoplanets")

exodat2$type <- fitk$cluster
exodat2$type <- as.numeric(exodat2$type)

exodat2$type[exodat2$type == 1] <- "cold_gas_giants"
exodat2$type[exodat2$type == 2] <- "others"
exodat2$type[exodat2$type == 3] <- "Rocky"
exodat2$type[exodat2$type == 4] <- "hot_jupiters"

table(fitk$cluster)
table(exodat2$type)
```

**8. Use a violin plot to illustrate how these clusters relate to the log-mass of the exoplanet.**

```{r}
ggplot(exodat2, aes(x = type, y = log(mass))) + 
      geom_violin() +
      labs(title = "Violin plot of log-mass of the exoplanet")
```

**9. Transform r_asc and decl into two new variables that are the same varibales but in values of seconds. Use these as coordinates to represent a celestial map for the exoplanets.**

```{r}
head(exodat$r_asc)
head(exodat$decl)

exodat$r_asc <- gsub(" ", ":", exodat$r_asc, fixed = TRUE) # convert to hh:mm:ss
exodat$r_asc <- hms(exodat$r_asc)

exodat$r_asc_sec <- period_to_seconds(exodat$r_asc)

# convert Declination to seconds and save as decl_sec
exodat$decl <- gsub(" ", ":", exodat$decl, fixed = TRUE) # convert to dd:mm:ss, where dd=3600ss
exodat$decl <- hms(exodat$decl) # for Decl, dd is similar to hh where :=3600ss

exodat$decl_sec <- period_to_seconds(exodat$decl)

# scatter plot represents a celestial map for the exoplanets
ggplot(exodat, aes(r_asc_sec, decl_sec, color= meth)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title="Celestial Map for Exoplanets",
       x="Right ascension (seconds)", 
       y="declination (seconds)")
```

**10. Create an animated time series where multiple lines illustrate the evolution over time of the total number of exoplanets discovered for each method up to that year.**

```{r}
ts.data <- exodat %>%
            group_by(meth, year) %>%  
            summarise(Count = length(meth)) %>%
            mutate(Count = cumsum(Count))

ts.data <- na.omit(ts.data)

ggplot(ts.data, aes(x = year, y = Count, group = meth)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = meth)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  transition_reveal(year) + 
  labs(title = 'Evolution Total number of exoplanets discovered by methods', 
       y = 'Number Discovered')

```

**11. Create an interactive plot with Shiny where you can select the year (slider widget, with values >= 2009) and exoplanet type. Exoplanets appear as points on a scatterplot (log-mass vs log-distance coloured by method) only if they have already been discovered. If type is equal to all all types are plotted together.**

```{r}

```

**12. Fit a linear regression model where log period is the response variable and the logs of host_mass, host_temp and axis are the covariates (exclude rows that contain at least one missing value). Include an intercept term in the regression model.**

```{r}

```

**13. Include in your RMarkdown document some model summaries and an interpretation of the model you have fit.**

```{r}

```

**14. Embed the Shiny app from (11) in your RMarkdown document.**

```{r}

```
